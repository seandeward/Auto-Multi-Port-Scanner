    ## Description:
        Initiate Socket connection to 'ip_addr' on 'specified_ports'. For each port, port_scan prints if connection succeeds, or will 'Pass' if connection fails.

    ## Args:
        ip_addr (_string_): The single ip address that the function will scan.
        specified_ports (_integer_, optional): The port(s) the function will scan. Defaults to range(1, 10000).
